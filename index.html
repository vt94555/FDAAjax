    Name: Tzuang, Victor
    Assignment: Final Project

    Description:

    The goal of this project is to create a 
    website that fetches data from the FDA and
    NIH and displays the result to the user. 
    Specifically, the website queries for FDA
    food recalls, medication descriptions,
    medication pill images, and molecule images.

    To query the food recalls and medication
    descriptions, the website queries openFDA. 
    Meanwhile, the medication pill images and
    molecule images were queried from the NIH's
    RxImage API, ChemIDPlus API, and PubChem API. 

    After the website loads, the user is prompted
    to enter a search term. Depending on which radio
    button is selected (food, medication, pill image, molecule image),
    a different fetch query is initiated after the
    user clicks the Submit button. If no search
    term is entered, the program displays a message
    asking the user to enter in a search term. If the
    fetch returns no results, then this is also displayed.
    The user also has the option to limit the number of 
    search results returned.

    From this project, I learned alot about using APIs and
    saw how different websites have different objects that
    are returned from API calls. Even within one website, such
    as the FDA medication website, different types of medications
    would return different objects. For example, over-the-counter
    medications such as acetaminophen would return a object
    with different fields, and would need to be processed differently
    than an object returned from a prescription medication. Also,
    it was very interesting learning how all molecules have an
    InChIKey assigned to them, which allowed the user to look up a 
    molecule by name, then retrieve the InChIKey from one API, then
    use that InChIKey to obtain the image of the molecule.
